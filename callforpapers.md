<h1 class="h2 text-center pt-3 pb-5">Call for Papers</h1>

We invite researchers to submit work in any of the following areas.

- Inductive biases for machine learning.
- Interpretable deep networks.
- Encoding prior information into machine learning models.
- Connections between machine learning and differential equations.
- Connections between machine learning, geometry, and mechanics.
- Applications to physics, robotics, biology, chemistry, and climate science.

A submission should be made in the form of an short 4-page paper using the [workshop's LaTeX style](https://inductive-biases.github.io/assets/IIBPSL_2020.sty).
Manuscripts should be anonymized in accordance with the [same rules as NeurIPS papers](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/CallForPapers).
References and appendices can extend as far beyond the 4-page limit as needed: we encourage use of BibLaTeX.
If the submitted work has previously appeared in a journal or refereed workshop or conference proceedings, including the current NeurIPS proceedings to be published, the workshop submission should extend the previous work.
